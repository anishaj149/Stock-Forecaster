# Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Stock Prices
Project in Progress!

Stock prices reflect a companyâ€™s ability to earn and grow, and can be used to determine the health of a market as a whole. This project will implement three machine learning methods to predict future stock prices using the dataset above. These methods are Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks, which have been used in the literature for this problem. We hope to determine which method, if any, provides the most accurate prediction of stock prices, as well as compare the performance with results in the literature.
